Network Anomaly Detection System (NADS) 

What happens when you implement network monitoring software using [nDPI](https://www.ntop.org/products/deep-packet-inspection/ndpi/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for anomaly detection?  Well, let's find out.  

This project is an experiment. It is based on a hypothesis that AI-based anomaly detection is the direction of the future.

* Phase 1 - implement flow tracking engine with Rust (July 2023)
* Phase 2 - integrate nDPI and metadata feature extraction (August 2023)
* Phase 3 - integrate TensorFlow/deep learnign for prediction (September 2023)
